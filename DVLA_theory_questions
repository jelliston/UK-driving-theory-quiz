    Identify high/low level markings on header tank where fitted or radiator filler cap, and describe how to top up to correct level.
    
Q106 Show me how you would check the parking brake for excessive wear.

Q111 Show me how you would check that the brake lights are working on this vehicle (I can assist you, if you need to switch the ignition on, please donâ€™t start the engine).
    Operate brake pedal, make use of reflections in windows, garage doors, etc, or ask someone to help.

Q112 Tell me how you make sure your head restraint is correctly adjusted so it provides the best protection in the event of a crash.
    The head restraint should be adjusted so the rigid part of the head restraint is at least as high as the eye or top of the ears, and as close to the back of the head as is comfortable. Some restraints might not be adjustable.
